# The-Snake-Modifier


In this project, our team developed a version of the classic Snake Game using Java and the SimpleGraphics library. We focused on enhancing the traditional gameplay by incorporating an easy mode for new players, an easter egg feature, and a cheat code. We also integrated background music to enrich the user experience, making the game more engaging. The final product was packaged into a JAR file.
